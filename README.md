Welcome to my personal TypeScript lab 🧪

This repo is my digital notebook, sandbox, and learning companion — all in one place.  
You’ll find notes, exercises, and type-level challenges that I’ve worked through while learning from:

- 📘 books  
- 🎥 videos & courses  
- 💡 challenge platforms  
- and random curiosity-driven experiments

If you’re learning TypeScript too, feel free to explore, borrow ideas, improve things, or just lurk around.  
**Maybe you’ll find something that clicks for you too.**
